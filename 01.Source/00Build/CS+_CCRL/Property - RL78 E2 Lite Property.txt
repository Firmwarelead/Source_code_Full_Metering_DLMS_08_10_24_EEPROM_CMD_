                               Use wide voltage mode                              Yes                                           Selects whether to rewrite the flash area in the wide voltage mode.If "Yes" is selected, the debug tool does the rewriting operation to the flash area in the wide voltage mode.
                               Erase flash ROM when starting                      No                                            Selects whether to erase the flash ROM before connecting to the debug tool. If "Yes" is selected, erase code flash and data flash and the connection to the debug tool are executed when the [Connect to Debug Tool] menu is selected. This item becomes "No" after the connection to the debug tool has been established.　When connecting by a hot plug-in, this setting is ignored, and becomes same as selected "No".
